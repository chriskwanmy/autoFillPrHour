This script is for created for filling up my PR application working hours.
Since the working hours counts every week and I need more than 52 weeks of hour record.
The fields I need to fill in contain "starting date", "ending date", "hours", "hourly wage", "company name".
Filling in manually will be a disaster.

Since it's only for one time use, the code will be just simple and it's spaghetti style. You can easily read and understand it, just adjust the tab(for moving to next field) and the company name, loop counts, hour record(the list) and just run.

If I have time in the future I will modify it into a more userfriendly version.
